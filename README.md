Project Title:

üéµ Music Recommendation System using Spotify Dataset

Objective:

The goal of this project is to build a Music Recommendation System using Spotify's dataset. The system leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature selection, and machine learning techniques to recommend songs based on user preferences and song attributes.

üìå Key Tasks & Workflow


1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Understanding
Load the Spotify dataset and explore its structure.
Perform data cleaning and feature selection for relevant attributes.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize important features (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability).
Identify patterns and correlations in the dataset.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
Normalize or scale the data if required.
Handle missing values or outliers.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Building the Recommendation System
Implement recommendation techniques:

‚úÖ Content-Based Filtering (based on song features)

‚úÖ Collaborative Filtering (based on user preferences)

‚úÖ Hybrid Approach (combining both methods)

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation & Optimization
Assess the recommendation system's accuracy.
Optimize the model to improve recommendations.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Integration
Convert the system into a web app or API.
Deploy it using Flask/Django or Streamlit for user interaction.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation & GitHub Setup
Create a README.md with project details.
Organize the repository structure
